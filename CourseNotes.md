Intro to CV (Udacity: Georgia Tech CS4476/6476)

1.  Introduction
*  Image Processing for Computer Vision
  1. 2A Linear image processing
    * Filtering
      * Convolution and correlation
      * Filters as templates
      * Edge detection
        * Canny edge detector
        * Laplacian operator (two-dimensional gradients)
  * 2B Model fitting
    * Hough transform
      * Line detection, circle detection
      * Generalized to arbitrary shapes
  * 2C Frequency domain analysis
    * Fourier transform
      * Basis sets of vectors (linear independence and spanning property)
      * Fourier Series -> transforms -> discrete transforms
        * Any periodic function can be expressed in sine/cosine
